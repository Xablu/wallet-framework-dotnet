# High-Level Test Strategy Report

## Introduction

This document outlines the high-level test strategy for the `wallet-framework-dotnet` codebase. The goal is to ensure that the wallet framework meets its core requirements and is ready for production.

## Test Strategy

The high-level testing strategy focuses on comprehensive end-to-end validation of core functionalities and interactions, adhering to the principles of understandable, maintainable, independent, reliable tests with clear feedback, focused on business value and end-to-end coverage.

## Test Phases

The test phases are aligned with the SPARC framework:

1. **Specification**: Define all acceptance tests, document test environments, data requirements, and security baselines.
2. **Preparation**: Scaffold test projects, create mock fixtures, and provision necessary testing infrastructure.
3. **Acceptance**: Implement and execute unit, integration, and BDD/E2E tests based on the defined acceptance criteria.
4. **Run**: Integrate all test suites into automated CI pipelines with matrix builds and parallel jobs. Embed security analysis tools.
5. **Close**: Review all test results, remediate failures, and sign-off on green CI runs. Archive test artifacts and generate a final summary.

## High-Level End-to-End Acceptance Tests

These tests are broad, user-centric, and verify complete system flows. They are designed to be implementation-agnostic and black-box in nature, focusing on observable outcomes.

### Credential Issuance Flow (OIDC for VCI)

*   **Description:** Verify the end-to-end process of a user receiving and accepting a credential offer from an issuer via the OIDC for VCI flow.
*   **AI Verifiable Completion Criterion:** The wallet successfully receives a credential offer, the user accepts it (simulated), and the credential is securely stored in the wallet, verifiable by querying the wallet's contents via a defined API endpoint and confirming the presence and integrity of the newly issued credential.

### Credential Presentation Flow (OIDC for VP)

*   **Description:** Verify the end-to-end process of a user presenting a stored credential to a verifier via the OIDC for VP flow, including selective disclosure.
*   **AI Verifiable Completion Criterion:** The wallet successfully receives a presentation request, the user selects the appropriate credential and claims (simulated), a valid presentation is generated and sent to the verifier, and the verifier successfully verifies the presentation, verifiable by monitoring the verifier's API response for a success status and confirmation of the presented data's validity.

### Handling of Different Credential Formats (mdoc and SD-JWT)

*   **Description:** Verify that the wallet can correctly receive, store, and present credentials in both mdoc and SD-JWT formats.
*   **AI Verifiable Completion Criterion:** The wallet successfully ingests and stores credentials provided in both mdoc and SD-JWT formats, and can successfully present claims from both formats upon request, verifiable by issuing and presenting test credentials of each format and confirming the correct data is stored and presented via API interactions.

### Secure Storage and Retrieval of Credentials

*   **Description:** Verify that credentials stored in the wallet are encrypted and can only be retrieved by the authenticated user.
*   **AI Verifiable Completion Criterion:** Credentials stored in the wallet are not accessible or readable via direct access to the storage mechanism (if applicable and testable at this level), and can only be successfully retrieved through the wallet's authenticated API endpoints by the correct user, verifiable by attempting unauthorized access (which should fail) and authorized retrieval (which should succeed and return the correct credential data).

### Interaction with Decentralized Identity Layer

*   **Description:** Verify that the wallet correctly interacts with the underlying decentralized identity components (e.g., Hyperledger Aries) for key management, DID resolution, and secure messaging.
*   **AI Verifiable Completion Criterion:** Key operations such as DID creation, key rotation, and secure message exchange through the decentralized identity layer are successfully executed as part of the issuance and presentation flows, verifiable by observing successful completion of these underlying operations via relevant logs or API responses from the identity layer components.

### Error Handling During Flows

*   **Description:** Verify that the wallet gracefully handles errors and exceptions during credential issuance and presentation flows (e.g., invalid offers/requests, network issues).
*   **AI Verifiable Completion Criterion:** When presented with invalid input or simulated network errors during issuance or presentation flows, the wallet displays appropriate error messages to the user (simulated/checked via UI or API response) and maintains a stable state without crashing, verifiable by injecting errors or invalid data and confirming the expected error handling behavior via API responses or simulated UI checks.

### Selective Disclosure with SD-JWT

*   **Description:** Verify that the wallet correctly handles selective disclosure of claims when presenting SD-JWT credentials.
*   **AI Verifiable Completion Criterion:** When presenting an SD-JWT credential, the wallet only discloses the claims explicitly requested by the verifier and selected by the user (simulated), verifiable by examining the presented credential data sent to the verifier's endpoint and confirming that only the intended claims are included.

### Handling of Large and Complex Credential Data

*   **Description:** Verify that the wallet can handle credentials with a large number of claims or complex nested data structures.
*   **AI Verifiable Completion Criterion:** The wallet successfully ingests, stores, and presents credentials containing a large volume of data or deeply nested claims without performance degradation or data corruption, verifiable by issuing and presenting test credentials with complex data structures and confirming data integrity and performance metrics via API interactions.

## Risk Matrices

The following risk matrices have been identified:

| Risk | Description | Mitigation Strategy |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Nullability and reference-type safety issues | Issues with `GetProperty`, JSON deserialization, or external-library calls returning null | Implement guard clauses, `required` modifiers, and defensive coding patterns; use unit, fuzz, and mutation testing to catch regressions |
| Security vulnerabilities | Known vulnerabilities in `BouncyCastle.Cryptography` (NU1902); deserialization risks (CA2326); thread-decorator empty-catch risks | Implement static analysis, fuzzing, and targeted security tests; use secure coding practices and secure coding guidelines |

## Architecture-Driven Test Patterns

The following architecture-driven test patterns will be used:

*   **Hexagonal/Clean Architecture**: isolate domain logic behind well-defined ports and adapters for maximum testability
*   **Dependency Injection & Interface Segregation**: break large services into focused interfaces, enabling fine-grained unit tests
*   **Test Doubles & Contract Testing**: use fakes for network/ledger RPCs; contract tests to validate external schemas and wire formats
*   **Mutation Testing & Coverage Gates**: integrate Stryker.NET (or equivalent) to ensure tests catch real faults
*   **Behavior-Driven & Data-Driven Testing**: leverage parameterized tests (xUnit Theories) for attribute conversions and protocol message parsing
