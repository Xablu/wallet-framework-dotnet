# High-Level Acceptance Test A-07: Software Composition Analysis (SCA)

## Description

This high-level acceptance test verifies that the project's dependencies are free from known security vulnerabilities by performing Software Composition Analysis (SCA). This helps mitigate risks associated with using third-party libraries and components.

## AI Verifiable Success Criterion

The test passes if the Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline executes a configured SCA tool (e.g., OWASP Dependency-Check) and the scan report identifies zero Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) with a severity score greater than or equal to 7.0 (High or Critical severity).

**Verification Steps (for AI):**

1.  Execute the SCA tool as part of the CI pipeline.
2.  Generate the SCA scan report in a machine-readable format (e.g., JSON or XML).
3.  Parse the report to identify vulnerabilities and their associated CVE severity scores.
4.  Check if any identified CVEs have a severity score ≥ 7.0.
5.  If no CVEs with a severity score ≥ 7.0 are found, the test passes. Otherwise, the test fails.

## Rationale

Software dependencies are a common source of security vulnerabilities. Automating SCA in the CI pipeline ensures that the project's dependencies are regularly checked for known issues, reducing the attack surface and improving the overall security posture.
