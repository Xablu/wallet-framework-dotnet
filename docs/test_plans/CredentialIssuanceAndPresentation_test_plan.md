# Credential Issuance and Presentation Test Plan

## Introduction

This test plan outlines the strategy and approach for testing the Credential Issuance Flow (OIDC for VCI) and Credential Presentation Flow (OIDC for VP) in the Wallet Framework .NET project.

## Test Scope

The test scope includes verifying the end-to-end processes of:

1.  Credential Issuance Flow (OIDC for VCI): A user receiving and accepting a credential offer from an issuer via the OIDC for VCI flow.
2.  Credential Presentation Flow (OIDC for VP): A user presenting a stored credential to a verifier via the OIDC for VP flow.

## Test Strategy

The test strategy focuses on comprehensive end-to-end validation of core functionalities and interactions, adhering to the principles of understandable, maintainable, independent, reliable tests with clear feedback, focused on business value and end-to-end coverage.

## Test Phases

The test phases are aligned with the SPARC framework:

1.  **Specification**: Define all acceptance tests, document test environments, data requirements, and security baselines.
2.  **Preparation**: Scaffold test projects, create mock fixtures, and provision necessary testing infrastructure.
3.  **Acceptance**: Implement and execute unit, integration, and BDD/E2E tests based on the defined acceptance criteria.
4.  **Run**: Integrate all test suites into automated CI pipelines with matrix builds and parallel jobs. Embed security analysis tools.
5.  **Close**: Review all test results, remediate failures, and sign-off on green CI runs. Archive test artifacts and generate a final summary.

## High-Level End-to-End Acceptance Tests

### Credential Issuance Flow (OIDC for VCI)

*   **Description:** Verify the end-to-end process of a user receiving and accepting a credential offer from an issuer via the OIDC for VCI flow.
*   **AI Verifiable Completion Criterion:** The wallet successfully receives a credential offer, the user accepts it (simulated), and the credential is securely stored in the wallet, verifiable by querying the wallet's contents via a defined API endpoint and confirming the presence and integrity of the newly issued credential.

### Credential Presentation Flow (OIDC for VP)

*   **Description:** Verify the end-to-end process of a user presenting a stored credential to a verifier via the OIDC for VP flow, including selective disclosure.
*   **AI Verifiable Completion Criterion:** The wallet successfully receives a presentation request, the user selects the appropriate credential and claims (simulated), a valid presentation is generated and sent to the verifier, and the verifier successfully verifies the presentation, verifiable by monitoring the verifier's API response for a success status and confirmation of the presented data's validity.

## Test Cases

### Credential Issuance Flow (OIDC for VCI)

#### Test Case 1: Successful Credential Issuance

*   **Description:** Verify that the wallet successfully receives a credential offer, the user accepts it (simulated), and the credential is securely stored in the wallet.
*   **AI Verifiable Completion Criterion:** The wallet successfully receives a credential offer, the user accepts it (simulated), and the credential is securely stored in the wallet, verifiable by querying the wallet's contents via a defined API endpoint and confirming the presence and integrity of the newly issued credential.
*   **Interactions to Test:** 
    *   The wallet receives a credential offer URI.
    *   The wallet fetches the credential offer details from the Issuer.
    *   The wallet requests the credential from the Issuer.
    *   The Issuer issues the credential.
    *   The wallet receives the credential and stores it securely.

#### Test Case 2: Credential Issuance with Invalid Offer

*   **Description:** Verify that the wallet handles an invalid credential offer correctly.
*   **AI Verifiable Completion Criterion:** The wallet detects an invalid credential offer and displays an appropriate error message.
*   **Interactions to Test:** 
    *   The wallet receives an invalid credential offer URI.
    *   The wallet attempts to fetch the credential offer details from the Issuer.
    *   The wallet handles the error and displays an appropriate message.

### Credential Presentation Flow (OIDC for VP)

#### Test Case 1: Successful Credential Presentation

*   **Description:** Verify that the wallet successfully receives a presentation request, the user selects the appropriate credential and claims (simulated), a valid presentation is generated and sent to the verifier.
*   **AI Verifiable Completion Criterion:** The wallet successfully receives a presentation request, the user selects the appropriate credential and claims (simulated), a valid presentation is generated and sent to the verifier, and the verifier successfully verifies the presentation.
*   **Interactions to Test:** 
    *   The wallet receives a presentation request.
    *   The wallet interacts with the user (simulated) to select credentials and claims.
    *   The wallet generates a valid presentation.
    *   The wallet sends the presentation to the verifier.

#### Test Case 2: Credential Presentation with Invalid Request

*   **Description:** Verify that the wallet handles an invalid presentation request correctly.
*   **AI Verifiable Completion Criterion:** The wallet detects an invalid presentation request and displays an appropriate error message.
*   **Interactions to Test:** 
    *   The wallet receives an invalid presentation request.
    *   The wallet attempts to process the request.
    *   The wallet handles the error and displays an appropriate message.

## Recursive Testing Strategy

### Triggers for Re-running Test Suites

*   Changes to the OIDC for VCI protocol implementation.
*   Updates to the credential offer processing logic.
*   Modifications to the secure storage mechanism.

### Prioritization and Tagging

*   Critical test cases will be tagged as "high" priority.
*   Test cases will be prioritized based on their impact on the overall system functionality.
