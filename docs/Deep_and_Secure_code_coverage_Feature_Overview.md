# Deep and Secure Code Coverage Feature Overview
## User Stories
- As a developer, I want to ensure that all code changes are covered by automated tests to maintain high code quality and reliability.
- As a reviewer, I want to verify that code coverage metrics are tracked and reported to identify areas needing improvement.
- As an auditor, I want to confirm that security vulnerabilities are identified and remediated through secure coding practices and regular security scans.

## Acceptance Criteria
- The solution must achieve a minimum of 80% code coverage for all new and modified code.
- Automated tests (unit, integration, BDD/E2E) must be implemented and passing for all code changes.
- Security scans must be integrated into the CI pipeline, identifying and reporting vulnerabilities.
- All critical and high-severity vulnerabilities must be remediated before code changes are merged.

## Functional Requirements
- Implement automated testing for all new and modified code.
- Integrate security scans into the CI pipeline.
- Track and report code coverage metrics.
- Remediate identified security vulnerabilities.

## Non-Functional Requirements
- Code coverage must be maintained at or above 80%.
- Security scans must be run on all code changes.
- Test reports and security scan results must be archived for audit purposes.

## Scope Definition
- This feature applies to all code changes within the WalletFramework.*.Tests solution.
- It includes the implementation of automated tests, integration of security scans, and tracking of code coverage metrics.

## Dependencies
- PRDMasterPlan.md
- Master acceptance test plan
- High-level test strategy research report

## High-Level UI/UX Considerations
- Code coverage reports must be easily accessible to developers and reviewers.
- Security scan results must be integrated into the CI pipeline and reported to stakeholders.
