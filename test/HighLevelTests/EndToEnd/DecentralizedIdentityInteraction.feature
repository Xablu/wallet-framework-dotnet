# Feature: Interaction with Decentralized Identity Layer

## Scenario: Wallet correctly interacts with underlying decentralized identity components

Given a user is performing a credential issuance or presentation flow
When the wallet needs to perform decentralized identity operations (e.g., DID creation, key rotation, secure messaging)
Then the wallet should successfully interact with the underlying decentralized identity components
And these operations should complete without errors

**AI Verifiable Completion Criterion:** Key operations such as DID creation, key rotation, and secure message exchange through the decentralized identity layer are successfully executed as part of the issuance and presentation flows, verifiable by observing successful completion of these underlying operations via relevant logs or API responses from the identity layer components.
