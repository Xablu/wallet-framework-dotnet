# High-Level Acceptance Test A-02: Integration Test Execution

## Description

This high-level acceptance test verifies the successful execution of integration tests that simulate interactions between different components and modules of the Wallet Framework. These tests are crucial for ensuring that the various parts of the system work together as expected.

## AI Verifiable Success Criterion

The test passes if the integration test suite completes execution in a Continuous Integration (CI) environment with zero reported failures.

**Verification Steps (for AI):**

1.  Execute the integration test suite using the configured test runner in the CI pipeline.
2.  Monitor the test runner output for the overall test result summary.
3.  Check if the summary indicates zero failed tests.
4.  If the number of failed tests is zero, the test passes. Otherwise, the test fails.

## Rationale

Integration tests are essential for validating the interactions and data flow between different parts of the system. Successful execution of these tests in a CI environment provides confidence that newly introduced changes do not break existing integrations and that the system's components are compatible.
