# Feature: Secure Storage and Retrieval of Credentials

## Scenario: Stored credentials are secure and retrievable only by the authenticated user

Given a user has a wallet with securely stored credentials
When an unauthorized attempt is made to access the stored credentials directly
Then the attempt should be denied
When the authenticated user attempts to retrieve their stored credentials via the wallet's API
Then the user should successfully retrieve their credentials

**AI Verifiable Completion Criterion:** Credentials stored in the wallet are not accessible or readable via direct access to the storage mechanism (if applicable and testable at this level), and can only be successfully retrieved through the wallet's authenticated API endpoints by the correct user, verifiable by attempting unauthorized access (which should fail) and authorized retrieval (which should succeed and return the correct credential data).
