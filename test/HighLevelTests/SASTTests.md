# High-Level Acceptance Test A-05: Static Application Security Analysis (SAST)

## Description

This high-level acceptance test verifies that the Wallet Framework codebase adheres to secure coding practices by performing static analysis. This helps identify potential security vulnerabilities early in the development lifecycle without executing the code.

## AI Verifiable Success Criterion

The test passes if the Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline executes the configured Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tools (e.g., Roslyn analyzers with security rules) and no warnings configured at an "error" level are detected.

**Verification Steps (for AI):**

1.  Execute the SAST tools as part of the CI pipeline build process.
2.  Monitor the build output for any warnings or errors reported by the SAST tools.
3.  Check if any warnings configured at an "error" level are present in the output.
4.  If no "error" level warnings are found, the test passes. Otherwise, the test fails.

## Rationale

Integrating SAST into the CI pipeline provides an automated gate to prevent common security vulnerabilities from being introduced into the codebase. By failing the build on "error" level warnings, it enforces adherence to secure coding standards and reduces the risk of exploitable flaws.
