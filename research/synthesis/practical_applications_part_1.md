# Practical Applications - Part 1

This document outlines how the research findings and key insights can be practically applied to the `wallet-framework-dotnet` project, particularly in the context of defining high-level acceptance tests and planning development tasks within the SPARC Specification phase.

-   **Informing High-Level Acceptance Tests:** The research findings, especially the identified knowledge gaps, will directly inform the definition of comprehensive high-level acceptance tests. These tests should be designed to cover the critical areas of edge cases, concurrency, security, performance, and compliance, with a focus on the specific vulnerabilities and challenges identified in the research. For example, acceptance tests should include scenarios for oversized payloads, invalid credential structures, concurrent wallet access, attempts at token tampering or replay, and verification of cryptographic compliance.
-   **Guiding Master Project Plan Development:** The detailed findings and identified knowledge gaps will be used to create a granular Master Project Plan. This plan will include AI-verifiable tasks focused on:
    -   Implementing specific handlers for identified edge cases in JSON and URI processing.
    -   Developing and integrating thread-safe mechanisms for concurrent wallet operations.
    -   Implementing security measures and corresponding tests against identified threats like tampered tokens, replayed requests, CSRF, and XSS.
    -   Setting up performance benchmarks for bulk serialization/deserialization and high-throughput issuance.
    -   Implementing and verifying cryptographic operations for FIPS compliance and adherence to OID4VC, mDoc, and SD-JWT specifications.
    -   Conducting targeted research cycles to fill the documented knowledge gaps, with specific tasks for investigating oversized payload handling, defining invalid credential configurations, developing race condition tests, and researching SD-JWT selective disclosure compliance.
-   **Leveraging .NET Features:** The research highlighted relevant .NET features and best practices. The project plan should include tasks to ensure these features are correctly utilized for robust and secure development.
-   **Structured Documentation as a Resource:** The structured research documentation within the `research` subdirectory will serve as a valuable resource for human programmers and orchestrators throughout the development lifecycle, providing easy access to findings, analysis, and identified gaps.
