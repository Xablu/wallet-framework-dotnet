# Diagnosis Report: WalletFrameworkCore Test Execution Failure (Attempt 2)

**Feature Name:** WalletFrameworkCore

**Issue:** Test execution failed with an MSBuild error indicating the project file `test/WalletFramework.Core.Tests/WalletFramework.Core.Tests.csproj` did not exist, despite the file being present on the file system.

**Analysis:**
Based on the previous diagnosis report (`reports/debug_WalletFrameworkCore.md`), the test project file `test/WalletFramework.Core.Tests/WalletFramework.Core.Tests.csproj` has been verified to exist at the specified location. However, the `dotnet test` command consistently fails with an MSBuild error (MSBUILD : error MSB1009) stating that the project file does not exist. This indicates that the issue is not a simple file path error but is related to how MSBuild or the .NET environment is interacting with the file system or project structure during the build process.

The code comprehension report (`analysis_reports/BUG-789/code_comprehension_report_WalletFrameworkCore.md`) identified potential code-level issues within the `Base64UrlEncoder` and `Base64UrlDecoder` classes, specifically regarding missing `DecodeBytes` and incorrect calls to the `Decode` method. While these findings are relevant to potential test failures *if* the tests were able to run, they are not the cause of the current MSBuild error which occurs *before* the code is compiled and tests are executed. The MSBuild error prevents the test project from being loaded at all.

**Suspected Root Cause:**
The root cause of the MSBuild error is likely related to the execution environment where the `dotnet test` command is being run. Potential factors include:
-   **File System Permissions:** The user account running the command may not have sufficient permissions to read the `.csproj` file.
-   **.NET Environment Configuration:** Issues with the .NET SDK installation, environment variables, or NuGet configuration could interfere with MSBuild's ability to locate or process the project file.
-   **External Interference:** Antivirus software, security policies, or other background processes might be temporarily locking or blocking access to the file during the build attempt.

These are issues that require investigation of the specific system environment and user configuration, which cannot be fully diagnosed or resolved through automated tools alone.

**Conclusion:**
The persistent MSBuild error is preventing the execution of the WalletFramework.Core tests. The issue stems from an inability of the `dotnet test` command (specifically MSBuild) to access or recognize the test project file, despite its physical presence. This points to an environment-specific problem rather than a code-level defect within the WalletFramework.Core library itself or the test project file content.

**Recommendations for Resolution:**
Human intervention is required to investigate the execution environment. The following steps are recommended:
1.  **Verify File Permissions:** Check the file system permissions for the user account on the file `test/WalletFramework.Core.Tests/WalletFramework.Core.Tests.csproj`. Ensure read access is granted.
2.  **Test Execution Environment:** Attempt to run the `dotnet test` command from a different terminal, potentially with administrator privileges (if appropriate and safe), to rule out terminal-specific or permission issues.
3.  **.NET Environment Check:** Review the .NET SDK installation. Consider running `dotnet --info` to check the installed SDKs and runtimes. Verify relevant environment variables.
4.  **Security Software:** Temporarily disable antivirus or other security software (with caution and awareness of risks) to see if it resolves the issue.
5.  **Repair/Reinstall .NET SDK:** If other steps fail, consider repairing or reinstalling the .NET SDK.

Addressing these environment-specific factors is necessary to resolve the MSBuild error and allow the tests to execute. Once the tests can run, the code-level issues identified in the code comprehension report (missing `DecodeBytes`, incorrect `Decode` calls) can then be addressed if they cause test failures.
