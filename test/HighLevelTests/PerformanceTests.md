# High-Level Acceptance Test A-08: Performance Benchmark Adherence

## Description

This high-level acceptance test verifies that key operations within the Wallet Framework meet defined performance thresholds. This ensures the framework is fast and efficient, aligning with the project's overall goals.

## AI Verifiable Success Criterion

The test passes if the Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline includes a performance test job that executes defined benchmarks and verifies that the measured performance metrics (e.g., execution time, memory usage) are within the acceptable thresholds.

**Verification Steps (for AI):**

1.  Execute the performance test suite as part of the CI pipeline.
2.  Capture the performance benchmark results in a machine-readable format (e.g., a benchmark report file).
3.  Parse the report to extract the measured performance metrics for the targeted operations.
4.  Compare the measured metrics against the predefined acceptable thresholds.
5.  If all measured metrics are within their respective thresholds, the test passes. Otherwise, the test fails.

## Rationale

Performance is a critical aspect of the Wallet Framework. By automating performance testing and setting clear benchmarks in the CI pipeline, we can ensure that performance regressions are detected early and that the framework consistently meets the required speed and efficiency standards.
