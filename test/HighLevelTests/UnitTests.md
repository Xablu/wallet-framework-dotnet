# High-Level Acceptance Test A-01: Core Module Unit Test Coverage

## Description

This high-level acceptance test verifies that the core modules of the Wallet Framework (`WalletFramework.Core`, `Oid4Vc`, `MdocLib`, `SdJwtVc`) have comprehensive unit test coverage. Achieving high unit test coverage is a key indicator of code quality and helps ensure the reliability of individual components.

## AI Verifiable Success Criterion

The test passes if the code coverage report generated by a standard .NET testing tool (e.g., Coverlet) for the specified core modules shows a minimum of 95% coverage.

**Verification Steps (for AI):**

1.  Execute the unit tests for the core modules using the configured test runner and code coverage tool.
2.  Generate the code coverage report in a machine-readable format (e.g.,Cobertura XML).
3.  Parse the report to extract the overall code coverage percentage for the targeted modules.
4.  Compare the extracted coverage percentage against the threshold of 95%.
5.  If the coverage is 95% or higher, the test passes. Otherwise, the test fails.

## Rationale

Comprehensive unit testing at the module level is fundamental to building a robust and maintainable software system. It allows for early detection of bugs, facilitates refactoring, and provides confidence in the correctness of individual code units. The 95% coverage target ensures a high degree of confidence in the core functionality.
