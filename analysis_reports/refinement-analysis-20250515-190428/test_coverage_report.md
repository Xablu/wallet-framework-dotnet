# Test Coverage Analysis Report - 2025-05-15

## Introduction

This report details the findings of an analysis of the test coverage within the `src` and `test` directories of the wallet-framework-dotnet project. The analysis aimed to identify gaps in existing test coverage and suggest areas for enhancement, aligning with London School TDD principles and the verification of AI Actionable End Results.

## Analysis Process

The analysis involved examining the code structure and defined components within the `src` directory and comparing them against the existing test files and their defined tests in the `test` directory. The `list_code_definition_names` tool was used to gain an overview of the classes and methods present in various modules, providing insight into the functionality that should be covered by tests. The presence and scope of existing test files were assessed to identify potential areas of insufficient coverage.

## Findings: Identified Gaps in Test Coverage

Based on the analysis, the following areas have been identified as having potential gaps or requiring more robust test coverage:

### 1. WalletFramework.SdJwtVc Module

The `src/WalletFramework.SdJwtVc` module contains core logic for handling SD-JWT Verifiable Credentials, including services for metadata processing, signing, and holding. The corresponding test directory, `test/WalletFramework.SdJwtVc.Tests`, appears to have minimal test coverage, with only an `ObjectExtensions` file listed. This indicates a significant lack of tests for the core functionalities of this module.

**Identified Gap:** Comprehensive testing of SD-JWT VC issuance, presentation, and verification flows, as well as the underlying service and model logic.

### 2. WalletFramework.Core Module

No code definitions were found in the top-level `src/WalletFramework.Core` directory or its corresponding test directory `test/WalletFramework.Core.Tests`. If this module is intended to contain core framework functionalities, this represents a critical gap in test coverage.

**Identified Gap:** Testing for core framework components and utilities, dependent on the actual implementation within this module. Further investigation is required to understand the intended scope and functionality of this module.

### 3. WalletFramework.IsoProximity Module

Similar to the `WalletFramework.Core` module, no code definitions were found in `src/WalletFramework.IsoProximity` or `test/WalletFramework.IsoProximity.Tests`. This suggests a potential gap in testing for proximity-related functionalities if this module is intended to contain such code.

**Identified Gap:** Testing for proximity-based interactions and related logic, dependent on the actual implementation within this module. Further investigation is required.

### 4. Specific Functionality within Existing Modules

While many modules within `Hyperledger.Aries` and `WalletFramework.Oid4Vc` have existing test files, a detailed code review would likely reveal specific methods, edge cases, or interaction scenarios that are not fully covered by the current tests. For example, error handling paths, specific utility functions, or complex state transitions might lack dedicated tests.

**Identified Gap:** Granular unit tests and targeted integration tests for specific components and scenarios within modules that currently have some level of test coverage.

## Recommendations for Test Enhancement

To address the identified gaps and enhance the test suite, the following recommendations are made, focusing on London School TDD principles and verifying AI Actionable End Results:

### 1. Implement Comprehensive Tests for WalletFramework.SdJwtVc

*   **AI Verifiable End Results to Target:** Define specific outcomes related to the successful issuance, secure storage, selective disclosure, and successful verification of SD-JWT VCs. For example, "AI Verifiable Outcome 3.1.1: Holder successfully receives and stores a valid SD-JWT VC," or "AI Verifiable Outcome 3.2.4: Verifier successfully verifies a presented SD-JWT VC with selective disclosure."
*   **Suggested Tests:**
    *   **Unit Tests:** Implement unit tests for `VctMetadataService`, `SdJwtSigner`, and `SdJwtVcHolderService`. Mock external collaborators (e.g., HTTP clients, wallet storage interfaces) to isolate the unit under test. Verify interactions with mocks and assert on the observable outcomes of the methods. Ensure tests cover various scenarios, including valid inputs, invalid inputs, and error conditions.
    *   **Integration Tests:** If the Test Plan specifies, implement integration tests to verify the interaction of `SdJwtVcHolderService` with the actual wallet storage, ensuring SD-JWT records are stored and retrieved correctly. These tests should not use bad fallbacks but rather fail if the storage dependency is unavailable or misconfigured.

### 2. Investigate and Test WalletFramework.Core and WalletFramework.IsoProximity

*   **AI Verifiable End Results to Target:** Dependent on the functionality of these modules. Prioritize defining AI Verifiable End Results for any core utilities or proximity features identified.
*   **Suggested Tests:** Once the functionality is understood, implement unit and integration tests as appropriate, following London School principles. Focus on verifying the observable outcomes of core operations and interactions with any dependencies.

### 3. Enhance Granular Testing within Existing Modules

*   **AI Verifiable End Results to Target:** Identify specific, detailed AI Verifiable End Results for critical operations within modules like `Hyperledger.Aries` and `WalletFramework.Oid4Vc`. For example, "AI Verifiable Outcome 1.1.2: Agent successfully processes a received Trust Ping message and sends a Trust Ping Response," or "AI Verifiable Outcome 2.3.1: Wallet successfully stores a credential record after a successful issuance flow."
*   **Suggested Tests:**
    *   **Unit Tests:** Write targeted unit tests for individual methods, focusing on different input combinations, edge cases (e.g., empty lists, null values), and error handling. Mock collaborators to ensure the test focuses solely on the logic within the method under test.
    *   **Integration Tests:** Implement integration tests for key interaction flows between components within a module or across modules, as defined by the Test Plan. These tests should verify the correct sequence of interactions and the final observable outcome of the flow, failing clearly if dependencies are not met.

## Conclusion

This analysis highlights key areas where test coverage can be significantly enhanced to improve the overall reliability and testability of the wallet-framework-dotnet project. By focusing on the identified gaps, particularly within the `WalletFramework.SdJwtVc`, `WalletFramework.Core`, and `WalletFramework.IsoProximity` modules, and by implementing tests that adhere to London School TDD principles, we can ensure that the system's behavior, including its failure modes, is accurately reflected and that AI Actionable End Results are robustly verified without relying on bad fallbacks.
