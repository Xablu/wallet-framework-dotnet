# High-Level Test Strategy Summary

## Research Process
The research process involved reviewing the PRDMasterPlan.md, architecture_overview.md, and code_comprehension_report.md documents to gain a holistic understanding of the system's goals, architecture, and user requirements. Additionally, best practices for high-level acceptance testing were gathered using the Perplexity MCP tool.

## Key Findings
- The system architecture follows a modular design, promoting maintainability, testability, and flexibility.
- Key components include Wallet Core, Credential Management, mdoc and SD-JWT Modules, OIDC4VCI and OIDC4VP Modules, Decentralized Identity Layer Integration, Secure Storage Service, and API/Interface Layer.
- Critical interactions and data flows include credential issuance and presentation flows.

## Core Recommendations
1. **Test Objectives**: Verify that the system meets requirements, components interact correctly, and it is ready for launch with real-data scenarios and API integrations.
2. **Scope & Scenarios**: Cover credential issuance and presentation flows, different credential formats, secure storage, and decentralized identity layer interactions.
3. **Methodology**: Use London-School style black-box tests, mocking approaches, and realistic environment setups.
4. **AI-Verifiable Criteria**: Define clear pass/fail criteria based on HTTP status codes and data consistency checks.

## Conclusion
The high-level test strategy aims to provide high confidence that the Wallet Framework .NET system works perfectly. It adheres to good testing principles and avoids common pitfalls.
