# Methodology

This research was conducted to gather detailed information and insights on specific deep testing areas for the `wallet-framework-dotnet` project to inform the SPARC Specification phase. The primary goal was to define comprehensive high-level acceptance tests and contribute to the creation of a detailed Master Project Plan.

A recursive self-learning approach was employed throughout the research process, designed to systematically identify and fill knowledge gaps. The process involved the following conceptual stages:

1.  **Initialization and Scoping:** The research objective and the relevant sections of the User Blueprint were reviewed to define the research scope, identify key questions, and brainstorm potential information sources. This stage resulted in the creation of documents outlining the research scope, key questions, and information sources within the `research/initial_queries` directory.
2.  **Initial Data Collection:** Broad queries were formulated based on the key questions and executed using a general AI search tool accessed via an MCP tool. The direct findings, broader contextual information, and summarized expert insights were documented in separate markdown files (`primary_findings`, `secondary_findings`, and `expert_insights`) within the `research/data_collection` directory.
3.  **First Pass Analysis and Gap Identification:** The collected data was analyzed to identify initial patterns, note any contradictions, and, crucially, document unanswered questions and areas requiring deeper exploration. This stage involved creating and populating documents for identified patterns, contradictions, and knowledge gaps within the `research/analysis` directory. The `knowledge_gaps` document serves as the driver for subsequent recursive cycles.
4.  **Targeted Research Cycles (Planned):** Based on the identified knowledge gaps, more specific and targeted queries would be formulated and executed using the AI search tool in subsequent cycles. New findings would be integrated into the data collection and analysis documents, and the knowledge gaps would be refined. *Note: Due to operational constraints in this cycle, targeted research cycles were not fully executed, and the knowledge gaps identified in the first pass are documented.*
5.  **Synthesis and Final Report Generation:** The validated findings and insights from the data collection and analysis stages were synthesized to develop a cohesive understanding, distill key insights, and outline practical applications. This stage involved populating documents within the `research/synthesis` directory. Finally, a structured final report was compiled within the `research/final_report` directory, including a table of contents, executive summary, methodology, detailed findings, in-depth analysis, recommendations, and references.

Throughout the process, all research findings and documentation were organized within a dedicated `research` subdirectory, following a predefined hierarchical structure. A non-negotiable constraint was placed on the size of individual physical markdown files, requiring content to be split into multiple sequentially named files within the appropriate subdirectories when necessary to maintain readability for human programmers. The User Blueprint served as a crucial source of context and requirements, guiding the focus and scope of the research.
