# High-Level Acceptance Test A-03: BDD End-to-End Scenario Passage

## Description

This high-level acceptance test verifies the successful execution of Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) scenarios that cover key end-to-end user flows within the Wallet Framework, such as credential issuance and presentation. These tests simulate real-world user interactions and validate the system's behavior from an external perspective.

## AI Verifiable Success Criterion

The test passes if all defined BDD scenarios execute successfully on a designated test environment (e.g., BrowserStack) via the Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline, with zero reported failures.

**Verification Steps (for AI):**

1.  Trigger the execution of the BDD test suite on the designated test environment via the CI pipeline.
2.  Monitor the test execution results provided by the BDD framework (e.g., SpecFlow) and the test environment (e.g., BrowserStack).
3.  Check if the results indicate that all scenarios passed.
4.  If all scenarios passed, the test passes. Otherwise, the test fails.

## Rationale

BDD tests provide a clear and executable specification of the system's behavior from a user's perspective. Successful execution of these end-to-end scenarios ensures that the critical user flows function correctly and that the integrated system meets the defined requirements. Running these tests on a platform like BrowserStack helps verify compatibility across different environments.
