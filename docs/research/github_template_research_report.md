# GitHub Template Research Report

## Introduction
The goal of this research is to find suitable GitHub project templates that can accelerate the development of the wallet framework project by integrating well-suited and thoroughly evaluated templates.

## Research Process
1. **Initial Search**: Conducted searches on GitHub for terms like "cookiecutter," "template," and "boilerplate."
2. **Specific Search**: Performed a targeted search for ".NET" and "C#" templates.
3. **Project Analysis**: Analyzed the current project structure for any template-related configurations.

## Findings
- The initial search did not yield relevant results.
- The targeted search for ".NET" and "C#" templates also returned no relevant results.
- The current project structure does not contain any obvious template configurations.

## Conclusion
Based on the research conducted, no suitable GitHub templates were found that meet the high certainty criteria of significantly accelerating development and aligning well with the project's core needs.

## Recommendations
- Continue using the current project structure and develop the wallet framework project from scratch.
- Regularly revisit GitHub for new templates that may better align with the project's evolving needs.

## Future Actions
- Monitor GitHub for new .NET and C# templates that could be beneficial.
- Consider creating a custom template based on the project's specific requirements.
