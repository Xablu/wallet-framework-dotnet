# High-Level Acceptance Test A-04: Property-Based Test Validation

## Description

This high-level acceptance test verifies the robustness and correctness of core validation and parsing utilities within the Wallet Framework using property-based testing. This approach explores a wide range of inputs to uncover edge cases and unexpected behavior.

## AI Verifiable Success Criterion

The test passes if the property-based test suite (using a framework like FsCheck) executes successfully with zero counter-examples found for the targeted validation and parsing utilities.

**Verification Steps (for AI):**

1.  Execute the property-based test suite using the configured test runner.
2.  Monitor the test runner output for the test results.
3.  Check if the output indicates that zero counter-examples were found.
4.  If no counter-examples were found, the test passes. Otherwise, the test fails.

## Rationale

Property-based testing is highly effective at finding subtle bugs in code that deals with complex data structures and validation rules. By automatically generating diverse inputs, it provides a higher degree of confidence in the correctness and robustness of critical utilities compared to example-based testing alone.
