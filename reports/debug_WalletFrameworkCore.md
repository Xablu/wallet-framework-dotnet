# Diagnosis Report: WalletFrameworkCore Test Execution Failure

**Feature Name:** WalletFrameworkCore

**Issue:** Test execution failed with an MSBuild error indicating the project file `test/WalletFramework.Core.Tests/WalletFramework.Core.Tests.csproj` did not exist.

**Previous Attempt Details:**
- Command: `dotnet test test/WalletFramework.Core.Tests/WalletFramework.Core.Tests.csproj`
- Error: `MSBuild error: project file did not exist`
- Modified Code Paths: [`src/WalletFramework.Core/Base64Url/Base64UrlEncoder.cs`](src/WalletFramework.Core/Base64Url/Base64UrlEncoder.cs), [`src/WalletFramework.Core/Base64Url/Base64UrlDecoder.cs`](src/WalletFramework.Core/Base64Url/Base64UrlDecoder.cs)

**Diagnosis Steps:**
1.  Verified the existence and location of the test project file `test/WalletFramework.Core.Tests/WalletFramework.Core.Tests.csproj` using the `list_files` tool. The file was confirmed to exist at the specified path.
2.  Attempted to re-run the `dotnet test` command with increased verbosity (`-v d`) to gather more details about the MSBuild error. The command failed with the same "project file does not exist" error (MSBUILD : error MSB1009).

**Findings:**
Despite repeated verification that the test project file `test/WalletFramework.Core.Tests/WalletFramework.Core.Tests.csproj` exists at the specified path within the project directory, the `dotnet test` command consistently reports that the file does not exist. This indicates that the issue is likely not a simple case of a missing or incorrectly specified file path.

**Possible Root Causes:**
-   **Permissions Issues:** The user account executing the `dotnet test` command may lack the necessary file system permissions to access or read the `.csproj` file.
-   **Environment Configuration:** There might be an issue with the .NET environment setup, including environment variables or NuGet configuration, that is preventing MSBuild from correctly resolving the project path.
-   **Transient File System Issue:** Although less likely given repeated failures, a temporary file system lock or corruption could potentially cause this.
-   **Antivirus or Security Software Interference:** Security software could be blocking access to the project file during the build process.
-   **.NET SDK Installation Issue:** A problem with the .NET SDK installation itself could lead to MSBuild errors.

**Conclusion:**
The test execution failure is caused by MSBuild being unable to locate or access the test project file, despite its confirmed presence on the file system. The exact root cause requires further investigation into the execution environment, including user permissions, .NET configuration, and potential interference from other software.

**Recommendations for Further Investigation:**
-   Verify file system permissions for the user running the command on the `test/WalletFramework.Core.Tests/WalletFramework.Core.Tests.csproj` file.
-   Attempt to run the `dotnet test` command from a different terminal or with elevated privileges (if applicable and safe to do so).
-   Check .NET environment variables and NuGet configuration.
-   Temporarily disable antivirus or security software (with caution) to rule out interference.
-   Consider repairing or reinstalling the .NET SDK.
