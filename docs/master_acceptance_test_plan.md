# Master Acceptance Test Plan

## Introduction
The master acceptance test plan outlines the strategy for high-level testing of the wallet framework-dotnet project. It covers key user scenarios and verifies complete system flows.

## Test Strategy
The test strategy is based on the high-level test strategy research report and focuses on broad, user-centric tests that verify complete end-to-end flows and system integration.

## Test Phases
The testing will be divided into the following phases:
- Phase 1: Credential Issuance and Presentation
- Phase 2: Decentralized Identity Interaction
- Phase 3: Secure Storage and Retrieval
- Phase 4: Error Handling and Large Data Handling

## High-Level Tests
The following high-level tests will be implemented:

### Phase 1: Credential Issuance and Presentation
- Test 1: Credential Issuance Flow
- Test 2: Credential Presentation Flow

### Phase 2: Decentralized Identity Interaction
- Test 3: Decentralized Identity Interaction Flow

### Phase 3: Secure Storage and Retrieval
- Test 4: Secure Storage and Retrieval Flow

### Phase 4: Error Handling and Large Data Handling
- Test 5: Error Handling Flow
- Test 6: Large Data Handling Flow

## AI-Verifiable Completion Criteria
Each test case will have explicitly stated AI-verifiable completion criteria.

## Test Files
The high-level acceptance tests will be implemented in the following files:
