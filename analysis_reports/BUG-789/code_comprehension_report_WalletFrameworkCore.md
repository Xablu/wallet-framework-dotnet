# Code Comprehension Report: WalletFramework.Core - Base64Url

## Overview

This report provides an analysis of the `WalletFramework.Core` project directory, with a specific focus on the `Base64Url` encoding and decoding functionality. The goal is to understand the structure and purpose of this code area and identify the cause of reported build errors related to missing `DecodeBytes` and `Decode` definitions in the `Base64UrlEncoder` class.

## Key Components

The `src/WalletFramework.Core/Base64Url/` directory contains two key components:

- [`Base64UrlEncoder.cs`](src/WalletFramework.Core/Base64Url/Base64UrlEncoder.cs): A static class responsible for encoding byte arrays into a Base64Url string format.
- [`Base64UrlDecoder.cs`](src/WalletFramework.Core/Base64Url/Base64UrlDecoder.cs): A static class responsible for decoding a Base64Url string back into a byte array.

## Relevant Code Analysis (focus on Base64Url)

Static code analysis of the provided files reveals the following:

- The [`Base64UrlEncoder`](src/WalletFramework.Core/Base64Url/Base64UrlEncoder.cs) class contains a single public static method:
    - `Encode(byte[] input)`: Takes a byte array, converts it to a standard Base64 string, and then modifies it to be URL-safe by replacing `+` with `-`, `/` with `_`, and removing padding (`=`) characters.

- The [`Base64UrlDecoder`](src/WalletFramework.Core/Base64Url/Base64UrlDecoder.cs) class contains a single public static method:
    - `Decode(string input)`: Takes a Base64Url string, reverses the URL-safe character replacements (`-` to `+`, `_` to `/`), adds necessary padding (`=`) characters, and then converts the resulting string back into a byte array using standard Base64 decoding.

Control flow within these classes is straightforward, involving basic string manipulation and calls to the standard .NET `Convert` class for Base64 operations. Modularity is good, with clear separation of encoding and decoding logic into distinct classes.

## Identified Cause of Errors

Based on the analysis of the source code, the build errors stating that `Base64UrlEncoder` does not contain definitions for `DecodeBytes` and `Decode` are occurring because these methods do not exist within the `Base64UrlEncoder` class.

- The `Decode` method exists, but it is located in the [`Base64UrlDecoder`](src/WalletFramework.Core/Base64Url/Base64UrlDecoder.cs) class. The code causing the error is likely attempting to call `Base64UrlEncoder.Decode()` instead of `Base64UrlDecoder.Decode()`.
- The `DecodeBytes` method does not appear to exist in either the `Base64UrlEncoder` or `Base64UrlDecoder` classes within the `src/WalletFramework.Core/Base64Url/` directory. This suggests that either the method name is incorrect in the calling code, or the required decoding functionality for bytes is expected but not implemented in this specific module.

Therefore, the build errors are a result of incorrect method/class referencing and potentially a missing method implementation (`DecodeBytes`).
