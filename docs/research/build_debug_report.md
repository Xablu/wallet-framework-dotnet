# Compilation Error Diagnosis Report

## Introduction
This report documents the diagnosis and proposed fixes for compilation errors encountered in the `WalletFramework.Core` project, specifically in `X509CertificateExtensions.cs`.

## Error 1: Type Conversion Issue
The first error is a type conversion issue:
```csharp
src/WalletFramework.Core/X509/X509CertificateExtensions.cs(62,13): error CS1503: Argument 1: cannot convert from 'IEnumerable<Org.BouncyCastle.X509.X509Certificate>' to 'IEnumerable<X509Certificate2>'
```
This error indicates a type mismatch between `IEnumerable<Org.BouncyCastle.X509.X509Certificate>` and `IEnumerable<X509Certificate2>`.

## Proposed Fix
To resolve this, convert `Org.BouncyCastle.X509.X509Certificate` to `X509Certificate2` using the appropriate conversion methods or ensure that the correct type is used in the method call.

## Error 2: Missing Method
The second error states:
```csharp
src/WalletFramework.Core/X509/X509CertificateExtensions.cs(70,70): error CS1061: 'X509Certificate2' does not contain a definition for 'GetEncoded'
```
This error occurs because `X509Certificate2` does not have a `GetEncoded` method.

## Proposed Fix
Use an alternative method available in `X509Certificate2` to achieve the desired functionality, such as `Export` or `GetCertContext`.

## Conclusion
By addressing these type mismatches and method availability issues, the compilation errors can be resolved, ensuring the successful build of the project.
