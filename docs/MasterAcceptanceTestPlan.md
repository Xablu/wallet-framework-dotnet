# Master Acceptance Test Plan

## 1. Introduction

This Master Acceptance Test Plan outlines the strategy and high-level end-to-end acceptance tests for the wallet-framework-dotnet project, aligning with the SPARC Specification phase. These tests define the ultimate success criteria for the project, ensuring the development of a fast, secure, and fully-automated test framework that verifies complete system functionality and integration from a user-centric perspective. The plan is based on the user's overall requirements as detailed in the User Blueprint and incorporates key insights from the strategic research conducted.

## 2. High-Level Testing Strategy

The high-level testing strategy focuses on comprehensive, black-box verification of the system's end-to-end flows and integration points. Informed by research into testing decentralized identity protocols (OID4VC, mDoc, SD-JWT), the strategy emphasizes:

*   **End-to-End Flow Verification:** Testing complete user journeys, such as credential issuance and presentation.
*   **Integration Testing:** Verifying seamless interaction between different modules and external dependencies (mocked where appropriate per London School TDD).
*   **Security and Compliance:** Incorporating automated checks for common vulnerabilities and adherence to relevant standards.
*   **Performance Benchmarking:** Measuring key performance indicators to ensure the framework meets speed requirements.
*   **Handling Complex Data:** Testing scenarios involving intricate payloads and data structures identified in research.
*   **Concurrency and Thread-Safety:** Addressing potential issues in parallel operations as highlighted by research.

This strategy ensures that the high-level acceptance tests provide high confidence in the system's overall readiness and robustness.

## 3. Test Phases

The high-level testing aligns with the phases defined in the Master Project Plan:

*   **Phase 1: Specification:** Defining the test plan and high-level tests (this phase).
*   **Phase 2: Preparation:** Setting up the test environment, scaffolding test projects, and provisioning fixtures.
*   **Phase 3: Acceptance:** Implementing granular unit, integration, and BDD tests that contribute to passing high-level tests.
*   **Phase 4: Run:** Integrating all test suites into automated CI pipelines and configuring reporting.
*   **Phase 5: Close:** Ensuring all acceptance tests pass, and archiving final artifacts.
