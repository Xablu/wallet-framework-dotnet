# Recommendations - Part 1

This document provides recommendations based on the research findings and analysis, focusing on addressing identified knowledge gaps and improving the testing strategy for the `wallet-framework-dotnet` project.

## General Recommendations

-   **Prioritize Targeted Research:** The identified knowledge gaps are significant and require dedicated research efforts. Prioritize targeted research cycles to gather the specific information needed to define comprehensive and effective tests in the areas of oversized payloads, invalid credential configurations, concurrency/race condition testing in the wallet context, specific security vulnerability testing, FIPS compliance verification, and SD-JWT selective disclosure compliance.
-   **Integrate Domain-Specific Testing:** Combine general .NET testing principles and tools with a deep understanding of the OID4VC, mDoc, and SD-JWT specifications to develop context-specific test cases that address the unique challenges and potential vulnerabilities of decentralized identity.
-   **Leverage .NET Features Effectively:** Ensure the development team is fully aware of and correctly utilizes the relevant .NET features for handling JSON, concurrency, security, performance, and cryptography to build a robust and secure framework.
-   **Utilize Structured Documentation:** Continuously update and refer to the structured research documentation within the `research` subdirectory. This serves as a living document to guide testing and development efforts and facilitate knowledge sharing among the team.

## Recommendations by Research Area

-   **Edge-Case Functional Tests:**
    -   Conduct targeted research to define a comprehensive set of invalid credential configurations based on OID4VC, mDoc, and SD-JWT specifications.
    -   Investigate strategies for handling and testing oversized JSON payloads and URIs, including potential limits and validation mechanisms.
-   **Concurrency & Thread-Safety:**
    -   Research specific patterns and tools for testing parallel wallet record operations against an in-memory store.
    -   Develop targeted test cases and methodologies for identifying and testing race conditions in critical components like `PaymentTransactionDataSamples`.
-   **Negative & Security-Focused Tests:**
    -   Research specific techniques and tools for testing against tampered JWTs and replayed HTTP requests in the context of the wallet framework's communication protocols.
    -   Investigate comprehensive strategies and tools for CSRF and XSS testing relevant to the framework's authentication flows.
    -   Conduct targeted research on the specific steps, configurations, and verification methods required for FIPS compliance of the wallet framework's cryptographic operations.
    -   Prioritize dedicated research into SD-JWT selective disclosure edge cases and compliance aspects, including testing with maximum nested claims.
-   **Performance Benchmarks:**
    -   Research and implement specific benchmarks for bulk serialization/deserialization of a large number of wallet records.
    -   Develop strategies and implement simulations for high-throughput credential issuance performance testing.
-   **Compliance Scenarios:**
    -   Conduct targeted research to identify the specific cryptographic algorithm and protocol requirements mandated by the OID4VC, mDoc, and SD-JWT specifications.
    -   Research concrete steps and verification methods for ensuring FIPS compliance of the wallet framework's cryptographic modules.
    -   Investigate compliance aspects and testing methodologies for SD-JWT selective disclosure.

These recommendations should be incorporated into the SPARC Specification phase, informing the definition of high-level acceptance tests and the detailed tasks within the Master Project Plan.
