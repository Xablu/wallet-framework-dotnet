# Executive Summary

This research was conducted to gather detailed information and insights on specific deep testing areas for the `wallet-framework-dotnet` project, as outlined in the User Blueprint. The objective is to inform the SPARC Specification phase, particularly the definition of comprehensive high-level acceptance tests and the creation of a detailed Master Project Plan.

The research focused on five key areas: Edge-Case Functional Tests, Concurrency & Thread-Safety, Negative & Security-Focused Tests, Performance Benchmarks, and Compliance Scenarios. A recursive self-learning approach was employed, involving initial data collection through AI search, followed by analysis and identification of knowledge gaps.

Key findings indicate that the .NET framework provides a solid foundation with relevant features for addressing these testing areas. However, the effective application and testing within the specific context of a decentralized identity wallet framework using OID4VC, mDoc, and SD-JWT require domain-specific knowledge and strategies.

Significant knowledge gaps were identified across all research areas. These include:

-   Lack of specific guidance on handling oversized payloads and defining invalid credential configurations within the wallet framework.
-   Absence of concrete strategies for testing parallel wallet operations against an in-memory store and identifying race conditions in specific components like `PaymentTransactionDataSamples`.
-   Limited information on targeted testing techniques for tampered tokens, replayed requests, comprehensive CSRF/XSS checks, specific FIPS compliance verification steps, and SD-JWT selective disclosure edge cases and compliance.
-   Insufficient guidance on benchmarking bulk serialization/deserialization and simulating high-throughput credential issuance in the context of the wallet framework.

These knowledge gaps highlight the need for further targeted research cycles to gather the necessary detailed information. The findings and identified gaps will be crucial for defining accurate and comprehensive high-level acceptance tests that serve as AI-verifiable success criteria for the project, and for developing a detailed Master Project Plan with tasks to address these specific testing needs. The structured documentation generated during this research provides a human-readable resource to support these subsequent planning and development efforts.
