# Security Audit Report: CredentialManager and Oid4VpClient

**Date:** 2025-05-20

**Modules Reviewed:**
- CredentialManager class ([`src/WalletFramework.CredentialManagement/CredentialManager.cs`](src/WalletFramework.CredentialManagement/CredentialManager.cs))
- Oid4VpClient class ([`src/WalletFramework.Oid4Vp/Oid4VpClient.cs`](src/WalletFramework.Oid4Vp/Oid4VpClient.cs))

**Scope of Review:**
This audit focused on the provided source code for the `CredentialManager` and `Oid4VpClient` classes. The review included a manual analysis of the code for potential security vulnerabilities, conceptually aligning with Static Application Security Testing (SAST) principles. Due to the minimal implementation and reliance on external services, a full Software Composition Analysis (SCA) or deep SAST was not feasible for the core logic which resides in dependencies. The review also considered the security implications for the required but unimplemented functionalities and dependencies.

**Methods Used:**
- Manual Code Review: Examination of the source code line by line to identify potential security weaknesses, logical flaws, and areas requiring secure implementation.
- Conceptual Threat Modeling: Consideration of potential attack vectors and risks associated with credential management and OID4VP presentation flows, even in the absence of full implementation.

**Findings:**

| Severity      | Description                                                                                                                               | Location                                                              | Recommendations                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **High**      | Use of a "dummy_query" for credential retrieval in `Oid4VpClient`.                                                                        | [`src/WalletFramework.Oid4Vp/Oid4VpClient.cs:32`](src/WalletFramework.Oid4Vp/Oid4VpClient.cs:32) | Replace the dummy query with robust logic that securely parses the `authorizationRequest` to determine required credentials and queries the `IStorageService` based on validated requirements. Implement strict access controls. |
| **Informational** | `CredentialManager` class is a placeholder with no functional implementation.                                                             | [`src/WalletFramework.CredentialManagement/CredentialManager.cs`](src/WalletFramework.CredentialManagement/CredentialManager.cs) | Implement secure credential management functionalities, including storage, retrieval, and lifecycle management, adhering to secure coding practices and relevant standards (e.g., using secure storage mechanisms).                 |

**Areas for Future Security Focus (Dependencies):**
The `Oid4VpClient` relies on `IPresentationService` and `IStorageService`. The security of the overall OID4VP flow is highly dependent on the secure implementation of these services. Critical areas requiring rigorous security review during their implementation include:
-   **Authorization Request Validation:** Comprehensive validation of incoming authorization requests, including signature verification, nonce validation, scope checking, and ensuring alignment with wallet capabilities and user consent.
-   **Presentation Response Creation:** Secure formatting, signing, and potential encryption of the presentation response. Ensuring only authorized and selected credentials/claims are included and properly bound to the proof of possession.
-   **Secure Credential Storage and Retrieval:** Implementing secure mechanisms for storing sensitive credential data and retrieving it based on validated queries, preventing unauthorized access or leakage.

**Risk Rating Explanation:**
-   **High:** Vulnerabilities that could be exploited to cause significant harm, such as unauthorized access to sensitive data (credentials).
-   **Informational:** Not a direct vulnerability, but highlights incomplete or placeholder code that requires secure implementation in the future.

**Conclusion:**
The security review of the current `CredentialManager` and `Oid4VpClient` classes identified one high-severity vulnerability related to the placeholder credential query in `Oid4VpClient`. The `CredentialManager` is currently a placeholder and requires secure implementation. The overall security of the OID4VP flow is heavily dependent on the secure implementation of the injected services (`IPresentationService` and `IStorageService`).

**Recommendations Summary:**
-   Address the high-severity vulnerability in `Oid4VpClient` by implementing secure credential query logic.
-   Ensure secure implementation of the `CredentialManager` when its functionality is added.
-   Prioritize rigorous security review and secure coding practices during the implementation of `IPresentationService` and `IStorageService`.
