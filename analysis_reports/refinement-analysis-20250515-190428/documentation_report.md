# Documentation Analysis Report

**Date:** 2025-05-15

**Purpose:** This report details findings from an analysis of the existing documentation in the [`docs`](docs/) directory and the codebase in the [`src`](src/) directory to identify areas with missing, incomplete, or outdated documentation. The goal is to provide a clear overview of documentation improvement needs for human programmers.

## General Findings

The existing documentation appears to be largely based on a previous iteration of the project, likely under the name "Agent Framework". This is evident from numerous references to "Agent Framework" packages, repositories, and sample projects. A significant effort is required to update the documentation to accurately reflect the current "Wallet Framework" project name, structure, dependencies, and features.

Specific general issues include:
- **Outdated Project Name:** Consistent use of "Agent Framework" instead of "Wallet Framework".
- **Outdated Dependencies and Versions:** References to specific, likely old, versions of .NET Core SDK and NuGet packages.
- **Outdated Package Sources:** References to MyGet feeds that may no longer be the primary source for packages.
- **Incorrect File Paths and External Links:** Links and file paths pointing to repositories or locations that may no longer be accurate for the current project.

## Analysis of Existing Documentation Files

### [`docs/errors.rst`](docs/errors.rst)

This document provides a basic troubleshooting step for a `System.DllNotFoundException`.
- **Finding:** The document is very brief and only covers one specific error.
- **Suggestion:** Expand this document to include a wider range of common errors encountered when using the Wallet Framework, along with detailed troubleshooting steps and potential solutions.

### [`docs/gettingstarted.rst`](docs/gettingstarted.rst)

This guide attempts to walk users through creating a new project and using the framework.
- **Findings:**
    - Contains numerous references to the old "Agent Framework" name and associated packages/sources.
    - Specifies outdated versions of .NET Core and Visual Studio.
    - Includes a clear "TODO: Basic message and routing info" indicating incomplete content.
    - References external sample project files and utilities using potentially incorrect or outdated links and paths.
    - The section on wallets references an Aries RFC, which is relevant, but the surrounding text needs updating to align with the current project's implementation details.
- **Suggestions:**
    - Rewrite the guide entirely to reflect the current "Wallet Framework" project name, structure, and the latest recommended versions of dependencies.
    - Update all package names, installation instructions, and code examples to use the correct Wallet Framework components.
    - Address the "TODO: Basic message and routing info" and provide comprehensive documentation on these topics.
    - Verify and update all external links and internal file path references to point to the correct locations within the current project or relevant external resources.
    - Ensure the wallet section accurately describes how wallets are handled within the Wallet Framework.

### [`docs/xamarin.rst`](docs/xamarin.rst)

This document provides guidance on using the framework with Xamarin for mobile agents.
- **Findings:**
    - Similar to the getting started guide, it contains references to the old "Agent Framework" name and potentially outdated package sources.
    - References specific versions of Android NDK and external libraries that may need verification for current compatibility.
    - References external repositories and sample projects for required libraries and examples using potentially outdated links and paths.
- **Suggestions:**
    - Update the document to use the correct "Wallet Framework" name and relevant package information.
    - Verify the instructions and dependencies for setting up native libraries for both Android and iOS with the current version of the Wallet Framework and supported Xamarin versions.
    - Update all external links and internal file path references to point to the correct locations.
    - Ensure the MTouch arguments and project file snippets are accurate for current Xamarin development practices.

## Missing Documentation (Based on Codebase Analysis)

Based on the structure of the [`src`](src/) directory, there are several significant areas of the codebase that appear to lack dedicated documentation in the existing `docs/` directory.

- **Core Functionality:** While the getting started guide touches on some basic concepts, detailed documentation for the core components and utilities within [`src/WalletFramework.Core/`](src/WalletFramework.Core/) is needed. This includes documentation for functional programming constructs, error handling, JSON utilities, and other foundational elements.
- **MdocVc Module:** The [`src/WalletFramework.MdocVc/`](src/WalletFramework.MdocVc/) module likely contains logic related to mdoc-based Verifiable Credentials. Dedicated documentation explaining this module's purpose, key components, and usage is missing.
- **Oid4Vc Module:** The [`src/WalletFramework.Oid4Vc/`](src/WalletFramework.Oid4Vc/) module appears to be a major component handling OID4VC protocols, including Client Attestation, DCQL, OID4VP, QES, and Relying Party Authentication. Comprehensive documentation for each of these sub-features, their APIs, and how to use them within the framework is critically needed.
- **SdJwtVc Module:** The [`src/WalletFramework.SdJwtVc/`](src/WalletFramework.SdJwtVc/) module likely handles SD-JWT based Verifiable Credentials. Documentation explaining this module, including concepts like VCT metadata, holder services, and signing, is missing.
- **API Reference:** A comprehensive API reference generated from the codebase would be highly beneficial for developers using the framework.
- **Architecture Overview:** Documentation explaining the overall architecture of the Wallet Framework, how the different modules interact, and key design decisions would aid developer understanding.

## Conclusion

The existing documentation for the Wallet Framework is significantly outdated and incomplete. A dedicated effort is required to:
1. **Update Existing Documents:** Revise [`errors.rst`](docs/errors.rst), [`gettingstarted.rst`](docs/gettingstarted.rst), and [`xamarin.rst`](docs/xamarin.rst) to accurately reflect the current project name, structure, dependencies, and features.
2. **Create New Documentation:** Develop comprehensive documentation for the core modules ([`WalletFramework.Core/`](src/WalletFramework.Core/), [`WalletFramework.MdocVc/`](src/WalletFramework.MdocVc/), [`WalletFramework.Oid4Vc/`](src/WalletFramework.Oid4Vc/), [`WalletFramework.SdJwtVc/`](src/WalletFramework.SdJwtVc/)), specific features within these modules, and provide an API reference and architecture overview.
